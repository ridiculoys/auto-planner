# Auto Planner: Your AI-Powered To-Do List

Auto Planner is a smart to-do list application that uses artificial intelligence to help you break down complex tasks into simple, manageable steps. Just describe what you need to do in plain English, and let the AI handle the planning for you.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI Task Breakdown**: Describe your task in natural language (e.g., "plan a birthday party for my friend") and the AI will generate a detailed, step-by-step checklist.
- **Conversational Clarification**: If a task is ambiguous, the AI will ask follow-up questions to ensure the generated to-do list is accurate and complete.
- **Dynamic To-Do Lists**: Create, manage, and track the progress of your to-do lists with a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily find specific to-do lists using the search bar.
- **Modern UI**: Built with a sleek and responsive design that looks great on all devices.
