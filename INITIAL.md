# Product Requirements Document: Auto Planner

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** In Development
**Author:** AI Assistant (Gemini)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview

Auto Planner is an intelligent to-do list application designed to simplify task management. It leverages generative AI to break down high-level user requests into a structured, actionable checklist. The application is built to be intuitive, responsive, and modern, providing a seamless user experience from task conception to completion.

### 1.2. Purpose

The primary goal of Auto Planner is to reduce the mental load of planning. Instead of manually creating detailed to-do lists, users can simply state their goal in natural language, and the AI will generate a comprehensive plan. This allows users to focus on executing tasks rather than planning them.

## 2. User Personas

- **The Busy Professional:** Manages multiple projects and needs a quick way to organize complex tasks without getting bogged down in details.
- **The Event Planner:** Organizes events (e.g., parties, meetings) and needs help creating detailed checklists to ensure nothing is forgotten.
- **The Everyday User:** Wants to manage personal tasks like grocery shopping, chores, or trip planning more efficiently.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. AI-Powered Task Generation

- **FR-1.1 (Single-Input Creation):** The user shall initiate the to-do list creation process through a single textarea input where they describe their task in natural language.
- **FR-1.2 (AI Title Generation):** The AI must generate a concise and relevant title for the to-do list based on the user's input.
- **FR-1.3 (AI Step Generation):** The AI must generate a series of actionable, step-by-step tasks (subtasks) required to complete the user's overall goal.
- **FR-1.4 (Conversational Clarification):** If the user's initial request is ambiguous, the AI must ask a single, clarifying follow-up question to gather more details. This process shall repeat until the AI has sufficient information.
- **FR-1.5 (Confirmation View):** Before creating the list, the application must present the AI-generated title and task list to the user for review in a confirmation view.
- **FR-1.6 (User Confirmation):** The user must be able to confirm and accept the AI-generated plan to create the to-do list.
- **FR-1.7 (Edit/Refine):** From the confirmation view, the user must have an option to go back to the conversational interface to request changes to the generated list.

### 3.2. To-Do List Management

- **FR-2.1 (List Display):** All created to-do lists shall be displayed on the main screen in a grid layout of cards.
- **FR-2.2 (Empty State):** If no to-do lists exist, the application must display an "empty state" view that encourages the user to create their first list.
- **FR-2.3 (Task Toggling):** Users must be able to mark individual tasks within a list as complete or incomplete using a checkbox. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished (e.g., line-through).
- **FR-2.4 (Progress Tracking):** Each to-do list card must display the completion progress, showing the number of completed tasks versus the total (e.g., "3/5") and a visual progress bar.
- **FR-2.5 (List Deletion):** Users must be able to delete an entire to-do list. This action should be accessible from a menu on the list's card.
- **FR-2.6 (Search/Filter):** The application must provide a search bar in the header to allow users to filter the displayed to-do lists by title in real-time.

### 3.3. User Interface & User Experience

- **FR-3.1 (Responsive Design):** The application interface must be fully responsive and provide an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **FR-3.2 (Modal Dialog):** The to-do list creation process (from initial prompt to confirmation) must occur within a modal dialog to keep the user in context.
- **FR-3.3 (Visual Feedback):** The application must provide visual feedback for loading states (e.g., when communicating with the AI) and user actions.
- **FR-3.4 (Toasts for Notifications):** The application shall use toast notifications to display system messages, such as errors.
- **FR-3.5 (Clean & Modern UI):** The UI should be modern, clean, and aesthetically pleasing, using a consistent color scheme, typography, and component styling. The app name "Auto Planner" should be displayed in the header.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Frontend & UI

- **TR-1.1 (Framework):** The application must be built using Next.js with the App Router.
- **TR-1.2 (UI Library):** React will be used as the primary view library.
- **TR-1.3 (Component Library):** UI components must be built using ShadCN UI.
- **TR-1.4 (Styling):** Styling must be implemented using Tailwind CSS. The color scheme and theming are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using CSS variables.
- **TR-1.5 (State Management):** Client-side state (e.g., to-do lists, dialog state) shall be managed using React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
- **TR-1.6 (Icons):** Icons must be sourced from the `lucide-react` library.
- **TR-1.7 (Images):** Placeholder images are managed via `src/lib/placeholder-images.json`.

### 4.2. Artificial Intelligence

- **TR-2.1 (AI Toolkit):** All generative AI functionality must be implemented using Genkit.
- **TR-2.2 (AI Flow):** The core AI logic is encapsulated in the `generateTaskBreakdown` flow located in `src/ai/flows/generate-task-breakdown.ts`.
- **TR-2.3 (Server-Side Logic):** The Genkit flow must be a server-side module, enforced with the `'use server';` directive.
- **TR-2.4 (Structured I/O):** The flow must use `zod` schemas (`GenerateTaskBreakdownInputSchema`, `GenerateTaskBreakdownOutputSchema`) to define and validate its inputs and outputs.
- **TR-2.5 (Prompt Engineering):** The prompt must instruct the AI to perform three main tasks: generate a title, generate steps, and ask a single clarifying question if needed. It must control the `confirmed` boolean in the output based on whether it has enough information.

### 4.3. Code Structure & Conventions

- **TR-3.1 (Project Structure):** The codebase must follow a structured organization:
  - `src/app`: Pages and layouts.
  - `src/ai`: Genkit flows and AI configuration.
  - `src/components`: Reusable React components, including UI components from ShadCN.
  - `src/lib`: Shared utilities, type definitions (`types.ts`), and helpers.
  - `public`: Static assets.
- **TR-3.2 (TypeScript):** The entire application must be written in TypeScript for type safety.
- **TR-3.3 (Linting & Formatting):** Code should adhere to standard linting and formatting rules provided by the Next.js toolchain.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1 (Performance):** The application should be performant, with fast load times and responsive UI interactions. Server Components should be used where appropriate.
- **NFR-2 (Usability):** The application must be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal instruction for a new user.
- **NFR-3 (Maintainability):** The code should be clean, well-organized, and modular to facilitate future development and maintenance.
- **NFR-4 (Accessibility):** The application should follow web accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA attributes, semantic HTML).
